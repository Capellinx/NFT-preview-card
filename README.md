### What I learned

I managed to develop myself in this project, I already have a brief knowledge on the front end, but it was very good to do this challenge even though it was "easy", I managed a lot.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-4z_u8LcGc&t=25s) - This helped me for the reason that I didn't know how to position very well with flexbox. I really liked this model and will use it from now on.
